# GenAAC
There are many Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems available ranging from simple to complex. One main complaint is that the pictures are line drawings or cartoonish - not real images. Also, many of these devices are quite cumbersome and large and make a child with disabilities attract attention when out in the community. This proposed communication application displays real pictures that rotate through several pictures of the same item. For example, if the child had a "cookie" on their device, it would rotate through real world images of a chocolate chip cookie, sugar cookie, and gingerbread cookie. Not only would this provide an opportunity for the child to communicate a want or need, it would also help him/her generalize the word, working on two skills simultaneously.
